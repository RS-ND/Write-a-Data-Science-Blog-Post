### Udacity DataScience ND: Term 2; Project 1

Summary

> In summary, this analysis examined the Seattle data from Inside Airbnb from three view points, the city, the data aggregator, and a user. From the city’s standpoint there are a significant number of hosts with more than 2 units that are not within the allowed area. From Inside Airbnb’s standpoint the occupancy rate measurement is flawed, but is reasonable with the data at hand. The lack of clarification from Airbnb itself might suggest that these numbers are underestimates, especially for some specific units. From the new host standpoint, it would be possible to set a reasonable market rate from the available data.

         reviews.csv is not critical to the analysis and isn't present in the repository as it is too large.
